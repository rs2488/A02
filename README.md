    <h1>Glossary</h1>
      <h2><strong>Branch: </strong>A branch is a separate version of a repository that allows users to work freely without disrupting the primary or main branch, allowing for easy publication.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Clone: </strong>A clone is a localized version of a repository, allowing editing and Git tracking without being online. It keeps local changes synced with the remote version, ensuring seamless remote access.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Commit: </strong>A commit is an individual file change, created by Git using a unique ID (SHA) to track changes, including who made them and when, and usually includes a commit message.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Fetch: </strong>Git fetch adds changes from a remote repository to a local branch without committing them, allowing review before committing them to the local branch.</h2>
      <h2><strong>GIT: </strong>Git, an open source text file tracking program, was created by the Linux operating system author and serves as the foundation for GitHub's social and user interface.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Github: </strong>GitHub Apps offer services to entire organizations, using their own identity, installed on user accounts, and granted access to specific repositories, with granular permissions and built-in webhooks.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Merge: </strong>Merging involves applying changes from one branch to another, often through a pull request or command line. This can be done via the GitHub.com web interface or command line.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Merge Conflict: </strong>Merge conflicts arise when different people make changes to the same file line or edit and delete the same file, requiring resolution before merging branches.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Push: </strong>Pushing involves sending committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com, allowing others to access them, even if changes are made locally.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Pull: </strong>Pull involves fetching and merging changes, such as merging remote file edits to local copies for up-to-date collaboration.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Remote: </strong>This refers to the version of a repository or branch hosted on a server, typically GitHub.com, which can be connected to local clones for synchronization.</h2>
      <h2><strong>Repository: </strong>A repository is the fundamental component of GitHub, containing all project files, documentation, and revision history, and can be public or private.</h2>
